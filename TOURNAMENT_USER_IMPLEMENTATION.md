# Tournament User Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the new Tournament User functionality that has been implemented, which allows users to view their tournament dashboard with open tournaments and assigned matches.

## New Components Created

### 1. TournamentUserController
- **File**: `app/controllers/TournamentUserController.scala`
- **Route**: `GET /tournaments/dashboard`
- **Main Action**: `dashboard()` - Shows the user's tournament dashboard

### 2. View Template
- **File**: `app/views/tournamentUserDashboard.scala.html`
- **Displays**:
  - Open tournaments (accepting registrations)
  - In-progress tournaments
  - User's assigned matches with status and opponent information

### 3. Enhanced TournamentChallongeService
- **New Methods**:
  - `getMatches(challongeTournamentId: Long)` - Gets all matches from Challonge API
  - `getMatchesForParticipant(challongeTournamentId: Long, participantId: Long)` - Gets user's matches
  - `getParticipants(challongeTournamentId: Long)` - Gets tournament participants

### 4. New Models
- **File**: `app/models/ChallongeModels.scala`
- **Models**:
  - `ChallongeMatch` - Represents a match from Challonge API
  - `ChallongeParticipant` - Represents a participant from Challonge API
  - `UserMatchInfo` - Represents match information for the dashboard

## How It Works

1. **User Access**: User visits `/tournaments/dashboard`
2. **Data Fetching**: Controller fetches:
   - Open tournaments (still accepting registrations)
   - In-progress tournaments (currently running)
   - User's assigned matches from Challonge API
3. **Match Resolution**: For each tournament:
   - Gets user's Challonge participant ID from `tournament_challonge_participants` table
   - Fetches matches from Challonge API where user is a participant
   - Resolves opponent names from participant data
4. **Display**: All information is displayed in a responsive dashboard

## Key Features

- ✅ **Tournament Status Display**: Shows open vs in-progress tournaments
- ✅ **Match Status**: Displays match status (open, pending, complete) from Challonge
- ✅ **Opponent Information**: Shows opponent names for each match
- ✅ **Responsive Design**: Uses Bootstrap for mobile-friendly layout
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with logging
- ✅ **Integration**: Uses existing tournament registration and file upload systems

## Database Integration

The implementation uses the existing `tournament_challonge_participants` table to map:
- Local users (`userId`) 
- Tournament registrations (`tournamentId`)
- Challonge participant IDs (`challongeParticipantId`)

This allows the system to:
1. Find which Challonge participant ID belongs to a user in a specific tournament
2. Fetch that participant's matches from the Challonge API
3. Display meaningful match information to the user

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. **Start the application**: `sbt run`
2. **Access the dashboard**: Navigate to `http://localhost:9000/tournaments/dashboard`
3. **Expected behavior**:
   - Page loads without errors
   - Shows open tournaments (if any exist)
   - Shows in-progress tournaments (if any exist)
   - Shows user matches (if user is registered and tournaments have started)

## Current Status

- ✅ **Compilation**: All code compiles successfully
- ✅ **Models**: All JSON formatters working correctly
- ✅ **Routes**: New route added and functional
- ✅ **Views**: Template renders without compilation errors
- ✅ **Services**: Challonge API integration methods implemented

## Mock Data Note

Currently, the controller uses a mock user ID (`userId = 1L`) for testing purposes. In a production environment, this should be replaced with:
- Authentication system integration
- Session-based user identification
- User login/registration system

## API Integration

The implementation successfully integrates with the Challonge API to:
- Fetch tournament matches
- Get participant information
- Map local users to Challonge participants
- Display real-time tournament status

This provides users with up-to-date information about their tournament participation and match assignments.
